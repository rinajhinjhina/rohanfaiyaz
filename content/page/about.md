Hi! My name is Rohan Faiyaz Khan and I am a web developer working out of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am currently working for [Xen Works](https://xen.works) as a Frontend Web Developer where I work with React and Typescript.

I am passionate about my craft as a web developer and in free time I experiment with a lot things including Svelte, Sapper, TailwindCSS and backend development. I blog about the things I learn in order to create a self-reference and to share the lessons I learned along the way. 

When I am not coding I am spending time in my other hobbies such as cooking (check my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rohanfaiyazkhan/) if that interests you

I am a pretty approachable person so if you live in Dhaka and want to get to know me, feel free
[to send me an email](mailto:rohankhan170@gmail.com) or [message me on twitter](https://twitter.com/rohanfaiyaz) and we can grab a coffee!
