## Remote work amidst global panic

I should preface this by contextualizing the current times we are in so that someone reading years later can understand. We are currently amidst the 2019-20 coronavirus epidemic that has at the time of writing infected 510.645 and killed 23,028 people worldwide. To combat it, several major cities have imposed lockdown and companies are advised to have employees work remotely where possible. This has forced more firms and employees adopt work from home than ever before.

Now remote work or work from home is certainly not a new thing. It is a luxury that can be afforded in the 21st century thanks to the magic of the internet. Certain industries such as tech, digital design and marketing have already been accomodating for remote work. However now industries that are technically slow in adoption of new practices are being forced to adapt due to the rapid change in global status quo.

So let us start with the why. One of the biggest advantages of remote work is that it completely cuts commute out of one’s daily routine. This saves a lot of time especially if you live in a busy city with a lot of traffic. For instance, I live in Dhaka and at my previous job it took me over an hour to commute to work each day. Removing that removed one aspect of stress from my life. For a business, remote work is also appealing because it means less expenditure on office space and office equipment.

But of course as some of you may be realising already working from home isn’t all great. Effective work from home assumes that one has an environment to work from home and that the organisation is structured to allow people working asynchronously. And not to mention the social isolation that comes with being remote. If you extrovert it might seem like torture to have to work in isolation. Basically, it is harder than it seems and may not be for everyone or every organisations.

Unfortunately right now little of that matters, and the time needed to prepare can no longer be afforded. Whether it is by force of government or by choice due to safety concerns, people have to start working from home whether they like it or not.

I have been working at a company that is fully remote for six months now and I have clearly had a lot of time to make the adjustment. So in order to get a more general response I decided to ask my friends, colleagues and peers how they have been adjusting. The answer were mostly negative, with most people that I have spoken to claiming that they hate it. Only one person responded positive, saying their company had done remote work before and they were prepared. The rest said that they found it too lonely.

Now I was not completely surprised with the response. Even under normal circumstances remote work is difficult for the reasons mentioned. However clearly these are not _normal circumstances_. People are stressed and worried about their safety and that of their friends and family. And most did not have ample time to prepare for the transition, seeing as how most cities went from seeing their first case of COVID-19 to lockdown within weeks.

Hence I am writing this blog post to try to offer some modicum of helpful tips for everyone in these trying times. We at XenWorks have been trying to make remote work click for us and these are some of the things me and my team do on a daily basis. Hopefully some of these can be useful for you as well.

### Prepare your space

The first thing one needs to work is a workspace. At an office this obviously isn't a problem but at home, the lines between work and home are very muddy. Two big problems can stem from this. Firstly, and this is a problem we will come back to throughout this post, it is difficult to __switch on__ your work mode. Let me explain.

When you go into your office to start a work day, your brain can clearly differentiate that this is where I work. This triggers your brain's muscle memory for focusing and doing work. At home this line isn't so clear. If you feel like you spend the first few hours of a work day without being able to focus, this could be the reason.

Secondly, even if you can focus there are likely to be interruptions due to your family.
