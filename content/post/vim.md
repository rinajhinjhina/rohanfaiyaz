 A colleague at my previous job was once looking at my screen and mentioned that he was impressed with how quickly I was moving around within my code editor. Granted he was not a developer and came from a non-technical background, but his comment surprised me as speed apart from that of typing was not something that I had given much thought before. Navigating through my workspace using a combination of arrow keys, find, go-to-line and the navigation keys such as Home and End were things I had learned simply through practice. 

 But it made sense. We, programmers, tend to spend some time writing code and a lot more time reading code, jumping between different points in our codebase, and tweaking minor things here and there. A significant chunk of our time is spent navigating, referencing and refactoring. Simply typing code faster is not enough to boost my productivity, I had to navigate and traverse my code faster.

## Enter Vim

For the uninitiated [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is a CLI based text editor that relies on short and expressive keyboard commands to do pretty much everything. Vim was something I had seen several Youtubers use and I noticed that watching a skilled Vim user at his job looked nothing short of wizardry. It seemed as if they could bend the text editor to their will at the tap of a few keystrokes. Above all it seemed so... __intimidating__. 

_All this editor kung fu that ditches the mouse seems way too complex for my meager self, and besides I rely on waaaay too many things on my VS Code setup. No way I am ditching that._ Or atleast, so I thought. 

First thing I learned was VS Code had a fantastic extension that emulates Vim, which let me leverage the full force of my Prettier and ESLint setup while also using Vim. So there went one of my excuses.
