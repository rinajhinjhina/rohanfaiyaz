### Hi, welcome to my blog

My name is Rohan, and I am full stack developer situated in Dhaka, Bangladesh working currently with React, Gatsby, Node.js and GraphQL. I love web technologies and I love sharing what I learn.

This is where I post about various things I am learning or experimenting with. I believe the best time to write about a topic is when learning it. Feel free to browse around or get in touch!
