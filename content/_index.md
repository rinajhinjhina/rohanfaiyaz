### Hi, welcome to my blog

Hi! My name is Rohan Faiyaz Khan and I am a web developer working out of Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am currently working for [Xen Works](https://xen.works) as a Frontend Web Developer where I work with React and Typescript.

I am passionate about my craft as a web developer and in free time I experiment with a lot things including Svelte, Sapper, TailwindCSS and backend development. I blog about the things I learn in order to create a self-reference and to share the lessons I learned along the way.
